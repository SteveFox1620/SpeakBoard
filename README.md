# SpeakBoard
After finding out it costs 700$ for the only option I know of to talk to non-verbal humans, with an electronic device. I decided I could use what I have learned in unreal UI to give our people something for free. This should be allowed since I won't charge for the software, according to the unreal engine license. The unreal engine is owned by EPIC. You may NOT sell this software. First release will be for windows x86_64. I plan to target linux, and android after.
